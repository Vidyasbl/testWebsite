		<h1>Learning language the natural way!</h1>
		<h3>Do you know one or more than one language? And do you wish to learn another language?</h3>

			Try finding your buddy to teach and learn a new language at the same time.

		<h3>How does it work? Who is a buddy?</h3>

			A buddy is someone who knows the language your are trying to learn and who wants to learn a language that you already know!
